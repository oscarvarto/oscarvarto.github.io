# Work and Good Customs

Welcome to my blog where I explore topics as an engineer:

1. **Technology and science** - Computer science, programming, artificial intelligence and science in general
2. **Social, economic and political issues** - Particularly focused on Mexico and Latin America (though I'm no expert on
   these topics)

The phrase "work and good customs" comes from José María Morelos' Sentiments of the Nation, where he proposed that the
nation should demand from its citizens nothing "but work and good customs" - a vision of society based on merit and
virtue, not inherited privilege.

This philosophy remains relevant today: a society's progress depends on the constructive effort and ethical values of
its citizens.
