# Sentimientos de la Nación: Morelos' Nation-Building Project

## Introduction

The "Sentimientos de la Nación" (Sentiments of the Nation) represents one of the most visionary and important political
documents in Mexican history. Written by José María Morelos y Pavón in 1813, this text was not simply a declaration of
independence, but a comprehensive nation-building project that anticipated many democratic and social justice ideas that
would mark the centuries to come.

## Historical Context: Mexico in 1813

### The War of Independence at its Critical Moment

By 1813, the Mexican war of independence had undergone dramatic transformations:

- **Hidalgo's death (1811)**: The movement had lost its charismatic leader but had gained in organization and
  ideological clarity under Morelos
- **Consolidation of the insurgent movement**: Morelos had proven to be a superior military strategist and more
  pragmatic political leader than Hidalgo
- **Significant territorial control**: The insurgents controlled much of southern and central Mexico, requiring
  political legitimacy for their project

### Novohispanic Society: Deep Inequalities

Early 19th-century New Spain was a deeply stratified society:

**Pyramidal Social Structure:**
- **Peninsulares**: Spaniards born in Spain, held the highest positions
- **Criollos**: Spanish descendants born in America, educated but excluded from political power
- **Mestizos**: Mixed population, without clear political rights
- **Indigenous**: Majority of the population, subjected to the caste system and tributes
- **Africans and Afro-descendants**: Enslaved or in conditions of servitude

**Structural Problems:**
- Caste system that determined rights based on racial origin
- Land concentration in the hands of the church and large landowners
- Differentiated tributes that perpetuated inequality
- Exclusion of majorities from political participation

### International Context: Enlightenment Ideas

**Intellectual Influences:**
- **French Revolution (1789)**: Ideas of equality, liberty, and fraternity
- **American Independence (1776)**: Model of democratic republic
- **Constitution of Cádiz (1812)**: Spanish liberal experiment that was suspended
- **Enlightenment Ideas**: Rousseau, Montesquieu, Voltaire influenced Creole thought

## Specific Motivations for the "Sentimientos de la Nación"

### 1. Need for Political Legitimacy

**The Congress of Chilpancingo**: Morelos convened this congress to:
- Give constitutional legitimacy to the insurgent movement
- Create institutions that would support the armed struggle
- Present to the world a coherent and viable political project

### 2. Differentiation from Hidalgo's Project

While Hidalgo had initiated a popular but disorganized movement, Morelos sought:
- **Institutionalization**: Create lasting governmental structures
- **Moderation**: Avoid excesses and indiscriminate violence
- **National project**: Go beyond mere independence toward nation-building

### 3. Response to Colonial System Contradictions

**Problems that Morelos identified:**
- The impossibility of reform within the colonial system
- The need for legal equality for all inhabitants
- The urgency of economic and social redistribution

## Detailed Analysis of the "Sentimientos de la Nación"

### Fundamental Points of the Document

**1. Absolute Independence (Point 1)**

> "That America is free and independent from Spain and any other nation, government or monarchy"

**Historical significance**: Morelos goes beyond the autonomy sought by some Creoles, declaring total independence not
only from Spain, but from any foreign power.

**2. Catholicism as the Only Religion (Point 2)**

> "That the Catholic religion be the only one, without tolerance of another"

**Context**: Although this may seem restrictive today, in 1813 this represented cultural continuity and social unity in
a deeply Catholic society.

**3. Popular Sovereignty (Point 5)**

> "That sovereignty emanates immediately from the people"

**Conceptual revolution**: This idea was radical for its time, rejecting the divine right of kings and establishing the
people as the source of political power.

**4. Separation of Powers (Point 6)**

> "That the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers be divided into compatible bodies to exercise them"

**Enlightenment influence**: Morelos directly adopts Montesquieu's ideas about separation of powers, fundamental to
preventing despotism.

**5. Equality before the Law (Points 12-15)**

**Elimination of the caste system**: The "Sentimientos" established that all inhabitants, without distinction of racial
origin, would be citizens with equal rights.

**6. Abolition of Slavery (Point 15)**

> "That slavery be removed forever"

**Advanced vision**: This proposal placed Mexico at the world forefront in human rights, ahead of other countries by
decades.

**7. Social and Economic Justice**
- Land redistribution
- Elimination of oppressive tributes
- Worker protection

### Revolutionary Innovations

**1. Universal Citizenship Concept**

The "Sentimientos" propose that all those born in America, regardless of their racial origin, be considered citizens
with full rights. This was revolutionary in a caste society.

**2. Representative Democracy**

Establishment of a system where representatives are elected by the people, not appointed by inheritance or royal decree.

**3. Preventive Social Justice**

It seeks not only political independence, but to transform the social structures that generated inequality.

## Morelos' Political Genius

### Pragmatism and Vision

**Unique Synthesis**: Morelos managed to combine:
- **Catholic tradition** with **Enlightenment ideas**
- **Creole nationalism** with **justice for indigenous peoples and castes**
- **Social revolution** with **institutional stability**

### Ahead of His Time

Many ideas from the "Sentimientos" would not be implemented until decades later:
- Definitive abolition of slavery (1829)
- Real legal equality (20th century)
- Labor rights (Constitution of 1917)

## Historical Impact and Legacy

### Immediate Influence

**Constitution of Apatzingán (1814)**: The "Sentimientos" served as the basis for the first Mexican constitution,
although it was never implemented due to the continuation of the war.

### Long-term Legacy

**1. Mexican Constitutionalist Tradition**
The principles established by Morelos influenced:
- The Constitution of 1824
- Juárez's Reform Laws
- The Constitution of 1917

**2. Social Justice Ideal**
Morelos' concern for equality and social justice became a constant in Mexican political thought.

**3. Leadership Model**
Morelos established the model of the leader who combines:
- Military capacity
- Political vision
- Social commitment
- Personal integrity

## The Historical Necessity of the Document

### Why Was This Document Necessary in 1813?

**1. Legitimacy Crisis**

The insurgent movement needed to demonstrate that it was not only destructive, but had a constructive project for the
nation.

**2. Ideological Competition**

With the Constitution of Cádiz (1812) offering limited reforms, the insurgents needed to present a more radical and
attractive alternative.

**3. Movement Unification**

The "Sentimientos" provided an ideological platform that unified various insurgent groups under a common project.

**4. International Communication**

The document served to communicate to the world that Mexico had a serious and viable political project, not just a
chaotic rebellion.

## Comparison with Other Foundational Documents

### United States Declaration of Independence (1776)
**Similarities**: Popular sovereignty, natural rights, separation of powers
**Differences**: The "Sentimientos" go further in social justice and racial equality

### Declaration of the Rights of Man (France, 1789)
**Similarities**: Equality before the law, fundamental freedoms
**Differences**: Morelos specifically includes abolition of slavery and elimination of the caste system

### Constitution of Cádiz (1812)
**Similarities**: Constitutional monarchy, some civil rights
**Differences**: The "Sentimientos" establish an independent republic with greater social equality

## Conclusion: The Truncated Project of a Nation

The "Sentimientos de la Nación" represents one of the most ambitious and advanced political projects of its era. Morelos
not only imagined an independent nation, but a just, egalitarian, and democratic society that would have placed Mexico
at the world forefront in human rights and social justice.

Morelos' execution in 1815 truncated this project, and Mexico would take more than a century to implement many of his
ideas. However, the "Sentimientos" remain as testimony to the extraordinary vision of a man who understood that true
independence requires not only political freedom, but also social justice.

The document remains relevant today because it addresses problems that Mexico still faces: inequality, social exclusion,
and the tension between tradition and modernity. The "Sentimientos de la Nación" remind us that true leaders not only
respond to the crises of their time, but imagine better futures for their peoples.

In Morelos' own words, the nation should ask citizens for nothing "but work and good customs" - a vision of society
based on merit and virtue, not inherited privilege. This remains a valid aspiration for any society seeking justice and
progress.
